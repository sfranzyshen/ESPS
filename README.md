# Goal
The goal of this project is to create four illuminated disc that have pressure sensors. When stepped on they will interact with each other to play the game simon. Each of the disc will be controlled individually by an esp8266 wifi micro controller. 
# Design
The Arduino IDE port for the ESP8266 is being used for the firmware development. A "master" disc will manage the LED lights, wifi access point, DNS captive portal, HTTP server, websocket server, and the simon game play logic. Each of the other three slave disc will handle the LED lights, wifi/websocket connection to the master disk, and sending messages to the master when the disc is stepped on. The disc will be contstructed from a frisbee with the electronics mounted inside of it using clear silicon to fill in the voids and hold it in place.
# Why?
As micro controllers become smaller and cheaper they are no dought going to find their way into basically everything. The idea with this project is to demonstrate how many small devices (parts) that handle limited functions can be joined together to create a larger more complex device. For example a wifi wall switch and a wifi wall outlet can be joined together to create a wifi controlled wall switch (fly by wire) where no actual high voltage connects between the switch and the outlet. "many small simple parts joined together (via wifi) to create a more complex and larger part."
